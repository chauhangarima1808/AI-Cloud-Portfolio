# AI-Cloud-Portfolio

Creating a professional portfolio using AWS Amplify with GitHub integration, ensuring seamless deployment and scalability. To enhance user engagement, an AWS Lex chatbot was integrated for real-time interaction. The chatbotâ€™s capabilities were further extended by connecting AWS Lex to AWS Lambda, enabling automated business email notifications via Amazon SES. Additionally, Kommunicate was integrated with Amazon Lex to enhance chatbot functionality and user experience. For secure data management, Amazon DynamoDB was utilized to store user details efficiently. This project highlights expertise in cloud-based web applications, AI-driven interactions, and serverless architecture.
